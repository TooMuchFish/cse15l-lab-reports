# Installing the VScode

[VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a website to download the free software, and the follow the [viedo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlIzFUI1QGA) to do the steps, you will be able to install your VScode easily
Notice your computer system and the VScode vision when you start this.


After you agree the agreement of vscode push to you, your vscode will ready to use, like the the image below.

welcome to the coding world!

# Remotely Connecting
First thing is download the OpenSSH if you have not, right [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)
Then we need to finish the setting up which called my course speacial account before the class, right [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
when we need to login to the server remotely, we just use the command " ssh cs15lsp22aqr@ieng6.ucsd.edu " input to the terminal in your VScode.
then you will see the image below, it means you are remotely connecting to your class.


# Trying Some Commands
there are a few commands we can use
* ls -lat
* ls -a
* cd
* cd ~
* pwd
* cp
* in <directory>
  etc.....
  

# Moving Files with scp
if we want to moving files with scp, now we saved a java file named WhereAmI.java, we can use the command "scp WhereAmI.java cs15lsp22apr@ieng6.ucsd.edu" to send it to remote server.
